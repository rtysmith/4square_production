// with ui_paint(), which on the animation page blocks ~92 ms pushing four 1 KB
// frames at 400 kHz. The real LED rate there is nearer 10 Hz. Every gait in
// leds.cpp is therefore a function of wall time and does not care — but the

// visible dip in an animation somebody is looking at. Room light is not a 1 Hz
