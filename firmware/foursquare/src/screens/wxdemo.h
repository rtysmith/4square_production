// wxdemo.h — THE BAKED FORECAST the showreel's weather segment shows.
//
// BAKED ON PURPOSE. The demo build has no radio at all (see demo.h), and the
// shipping build's WiFi cannot hold an association on this board, so a live
// forecast has nowhere to come from. What the segment demonstrates is the
// PRESENTATION — one day per panel, an animated 1-bit sky, the temperature —
// and for a marketing clip the weather should be pleasant anyway.
//
// This block is the WHOLE of the data: change the city and the four rows and
// the segment follows. Day names are labels, not derived from the RTC — a
// baked forecast with computed day names would claim a freshness it does not
// have. The TL panel shows the CITY (today is implied); the other three show
// the day.
//
// `kind` is a WxKind from anim.h: WX_SUNNY, WX_PARTLY, WX_RAIN. One rainy day
// is kept in deliberately — the rain drawing is the most charming of the
// three, and an all-sun forecast reads as a mockup.
