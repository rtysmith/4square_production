// a pixel survives only if it is lit AND at least one of its four neighbours
// is not. That leaves a 1 px trace of exactly the same typeface at exactly the
// same metrics, so every fit calculation still holds.
//
// It is also the single biggest burn-in win available. A size-7 '8' goes from
// ~800 lit pixels to ~170 — and lifetime on these panels runs as roughly the
// inverse 1.4 power of drive current, on glyphs that sit in the same place for
// years.
//
// File-scope, not a local: a 1 KB malloc and free on every repaint would
// fragment the heap on a device expected to run for months.
static GFXcanvas1 scratch(SCR_W, SCR_H);

// ---- inverted looks -------------------------------------------------------
// An inverted style is the SAME glyph work, composited as a negative inside a
// chip that hugs the ink. Two things about that are deliberate.
//
// FIRST: IT HAPPENS INSIDE THE ELEMENT, between one ELEM() and the next. The
// obvious implementation — draw the whole face, then invert the canvas at the
// end of face_render() — cannot be proven. The host prover snapshots AND
// CLEARS the canvas at every element boundary, so a post-pass would invert a
// nearly-empty canvas on the host and a full one on the device: the prover
// would be proving a different program from the one that ships. Every negative
// below is composited before the next ELEM() call, so the element the prover
// lifts out is exactly the block of pixels the panel gets.
//
// SECOND: A CHIP, NEVER THE SAFE AREA. Inverting the whole 116x52 is 73% lit,
// which on an OLED that shows the same face for years is a lifetime problem
// rather than a style choice. Hugging the ink with a few pixels of padding and
// dropping the glyph a size or two lands the inverted looks at ~28-33% —
// still over the 15% always-on budget, reported as a warning, and a trade the
// user makes by pressing MODE. Panel-level inversion (SSD1306 0xA7) stays OFF
// for the same reason: it multiplies fill factor across the entire panel.
//
// THIRD, and this one the prover found rather than the design: THE CHIP IS
// SCREENED, not solid. A solid block gets NO relief from the anti-burn-in
// shift — a pixel in its interior is lit at every offset in the envelope, so
// its duty is 1.000 and the shift buys it exactly nothing. The prover measures
// that (SHIFT RELIEF, floor 1.10x) and failed 1261 screens on the first solid
// version. Dropping one pixel in every 2x2 cell fixes it at the root: because
// the whole canvas is what shifts, the screen pattern travels with the image,
// so every pixel in the chip is dark for a quarter of the offsets. Relief
// comes out at ~1.33x, fill drops by a quarter, and at this size a 3-in-4
// screen reads as a solid lit block from anywhere but nose-to-glass.
//
// The composite is ADDITIVE — it only ever sets pixels, never clears them.
// The knockout is achieved by NOT DRAWING the glyph, exactly like the stencil
// bands above, so an inverted element cannot damage a neighbouring one in a
// way the prover structurally cannot see.

// chrome is drawn at NORMAL polarity — a lit rule, a lit card, a lit tick
// scale — and a plate that reached it would be lit underneath it, so the
// chrome would vanish into its own plate. On DIAL, whose entire chrome IS the
// scale, that loses the theme.
//
// So the clamp is a variable rather than the SAFE_* constants, RESET TO THE
// SAFE AREA AT THE TOP OF EVERY face_render() CALL. That reset is what keeps
// faces.cpp pure in the sense the prover needs: the same inputs draw the same
// pixels, because nothing here survives a call.

// REMEMBERS ITS FONT AND TEXT SIZE, so whatever the last render left set is

//
// That went unnoticed for as long as every renderer used the same built-in
// 5x7 font. The themed faces broke it: an INVERTED themed element draws into
// `neg` with a 46 px custom font, and the next classic inverted element —
// stack2_impl, face_words, face_shadow — calls fx_left(neg, ...) with
// setTextSize(3) and no setFont(), so the 5x7 glyph it asked for came out as
// a 138 px theme glyph smeared across the panel. Measured, not reasoned: the
// DATE panel's month rendered as a full-panel screened blob, 4328 findings.

// ===========================================================================
// THE FIVE PORTED THEMES
// ===========================================================================
// Ported from firmware D (screens/theme.h, which is the design document for
// all of this and worth reading before touching anything below).
//
// WHAT A THEME IS. Not a glyph trick — a TYPE SYSTEM. Five tiers of one real
// outline face, generated by D's fontgen.py, which SOLVES FOR THE PIXEL HEIGHT
// rather than taking a point size, so "46" means the same thing in every
// family and the themes are comparable rather than merely all present:
//
//   big   46-48 px  digits only (0-9)   hour, minute
//   bigo  46-48 px  the true-outline variant of big
//   lg    28 px     0x20-0x5A           weekday, the day number
//   md    20 px     0x20-0x5A           the inverted weekday
//   sm    10 px     0x20-0x5A           the month label, the corner overlay
//
// Plus the CHROME the family wears. Porting a theme means porting both; a
// lookalike drawn with the built-in 5x7 font would be neither.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ⛔ THE ARCHITECTURAL TRANSLATION — FIRMWARE C HAS NO SHEET ⛔
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Firmware D draws in SHEET coordinates: the four panels are windows onto one
// 339x295 canvas, so a rule can be one line crossing the bezel and a tick
// scale can be one instrument spanning two panels. FIRMWARE C HAS NO SUCH
// THING. Each panel is an independent 128x64 GFXcanvas1 and this file draws
// one widget per panel knowing nothing whatever about its neighbours — it is
// not even told which slot it is. So:
//
//   CH_CARD and CH_BRACKET port EXACTLY. They were already per-window in D;
//   D drew them at win_x0..win_x1 of one window, which is this panel's safe
//   area with the theme inset applied. Same pixels.
//
//   CH_RULE ports EXACTLY TOO, and that is arithmetic rather than luck. D's
//   rule looks sheet-wide but sheet_hline() clips every span to the UNION OF
//   THE WINDOW RECTANGLES, so what actually reaches a panel is a hairline from
//   that window's own left inset to its own right inset. That is what is drawn
//   here. Both panels of a row still put it on the same canvas row, so on the
//   real glass the two segments are collinear and the eye completes the line
//   across the bezel exactly as it did in D. Nothing is lost.
//
//   CH_RING IS THE ONE THAT CANNOT PORT, AND HERE IS EXACTLY WHAT CHANGED.
//   In D the tick scale is ONE instrument laid across the whole sheet: 25
//   ticks from sheet x 6 to x 338, filled up to the current minute. Seven of
//   them land in the bezel and are never drawn, so the LEFT panel shows the
//   first nine ticks (roughly minutes 0-22) and the RIGHT panel the last nine
//   (roughly 38-60), and the fill sweeps across the whole sheet once an hour.
//   A panel is a WINDOW ONTO a scale that is bigger than it.
//
//   C cannot express that. This file is not told which panel it is drawing, so
//   it cannot know whether to show the low ticks or the high ones, and there
//   is no sheet to be a window onto. THE ADAPTATION: every panel carries its
//   OWN COMPLETE minute scale — nine ticks across this panel's safe width, at
//   the same visual density D's sheet scale had once the bezel ate two thirds
//   of it (~14 px pitch), filled to the same fraction of the hour.
//
//   WHAT IS LOST: the one-instrument illusion. In D the fill crossed the bezel
//   and swept the sheet once per hour; here all four panels show the same
//   scale filling in parallel. The INFORMATION is identical — how far through
//   the hour we are, to about seven minutes — and so is the density and the
//   3 px/2 px long-short tick treatment. What is gone is the statement that
//   the four panels are one surface. That statement belongs to a sheet, and
//   faking it here would mean inventing a slot number this file is not given.

//
// ROUNDEL AND CAPSULE ARE THE TWO THAT COST THE MOST, and they are the same

// the negatives cost the panel LESS than the positives they mirror.

// ---- the inverted variant of a theme --------------------------------------
// C ALREADY HAS A WORKING, STYLE-AGNOSTIC INVERSION and this reuses it whole:
// the element draws into `neg`, emit_negative() composites a screened chip
// with the glyph knocked out of it, and all of that happens BETWEEN one ELEM()
// and the next. That timing is not incidental — the host prover snapshots and
// CLEARS the canvas at every element boundary, so a post-pass over the whole
// face would invert a nearly-empty canvas on the host and a full one on the
// device, and the prover would be proving a different program from the one
// that ships.
//
// FIRMWARE D DID EXACTLY THAT POST-PASS. Its inverted render is two passes
// over the whole page with a global `sheet_fg` flipped to 0 in between. That
// is unprovable here by construction, so the mechanism was NOT ported — only
// the POLICY was, and the policy is the part with the findings behind it:
//
//   1. THE PLATE IS BOUNDED BY THE TEXT INK, NOT BY THE PANEL. C's chip
//      already does this.
//   2. CHROME IS MEASURED OUT OF THE PLATE AND DRAWN AT NORMAL POLARITY.
//      Otherwise a card or a rule spanning the panel drags the plate to full
//      width and turns a bounded tile into a lit field — D measured 26% vs
//      62% on that exact question. Here the chrome is simply drawn on `c`
//      rather than on `neg`, so it never enters the ink box the chip is
//      fitted to, and the chip is clamped off it besides (chip_clamp_reset).
//   3. INVERTED GLYPHS RUN SMALLER. C drops a size-7 digit to size 5 for the
//      same reason; a themed panel drops from `big` to `lg` and a themed
//      weekday from `lg` to `md`. A chip around 46 px numerals is two thirds
//      of the panel.
//
// WHICH THEMES' CHROME DOES NOT SURVIVE THIS CLEANLY: none is dropped, but
// CAPSULE's card is the one that changes meaning. Filled, the card reads as
// the tile's own edge with the numerals floating inside it. Inverted, there
// are now two nested rounded shapes — the 1 px card on the boundary and the
// lit plate inside it — and the plate, not the card, is what the eye reads as
// the tile. The card survives as a hairline frame around it. That is the
// honest per-panel equivalent of what D got, and it is called out here rather
// than left for someone to notice on the glass.

// always enough. CAPSULE gives up 6 px of inset at each end and its weekday is
// 83 px of tracked caps, so beside a three-character temperature there is
// nowhere left to go, and a nudge that runs out of room silently CLAMPS —
// which puts the block back against the overlay it was moved off. The prover
// caught exactly that, as CROWDED on the widest weekday of the widest theme.
//
// So a block that cannot clear the overlay steps DOWN A TIER instead. Fitting
// rather than assuming a size is also what makes this right on all five
// families at once: ROUNDEL's display face is a third wider than DATASHEET's,
// and a hand-picked step would clip one or waste the other.

// 116 px safe width. Shifting left both increases the gap to a bottom-right
// overlay and stays inside the envelope at every size.
