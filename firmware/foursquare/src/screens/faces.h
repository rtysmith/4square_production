//
// EVERYTHING IN HERE IS PURE. A face is handed a GFXcanvas1 (plain RAM) and a
// snapshot of the data; it cannot reach I2C, cannot read a global, cannot know
// what time it is except through what it was passed. That is what lets the
// host-side prover in tools/layoutcheck compile THIS EXACT SOURCE, against the
// real Adafruit_GFX and the real font, and prove properties about the pixels
// that will actually appear on the panels.

// ---- element attribution --------------------------------------------------
// Faces call ELEM() before each independent thing they draw. On the device the
// hook is null and this costs one null check per element. On the host the
// prover installs a hook that lifts each element into its own bitmap, so it
// can prove no two of them share a pixel.
//
// THE RULE: anything that could conceivably collide with something else on the
// same panel must be its own element. Two elements that overlap by one pixel
// is a bug the prover will fail the build over.

// ---- inverted looks -------------------------------------------------------
// MODE cycles the clock's look, and half those looks are NEGATIVES: a lit chip
// with the glyph knocked out of it. That is expressed as a bit OR'd onto a
// Style rather than as six more enum values, because the stored setting in the
// EEPROM is a Style and must keep meaning exactly what it meant before —
// inversion is a compositing mode the MODE button applies, not a new glyph.
//
// 0x40 is chosen to sit clear of S_COUNT (6 when this was written, 11 since
// the theme port) with room for the enum to keep growing.

// ---- the OUTLINE variant of a themed face ---------------------------------
// The five ported families each ship TWO display tiers: `big`, a solid
// numeral, and `bigo`, a TRUE closed outline of the same glyph (the
// thresholded form minus its own erosion — not a stroke font, which is why its
// counters come out as loops rather than as a dashed fragment).
//
// So "outline vs filled" for a themed face is not a second design, it is the
// tier the theme already carries, and it is expressed the same way inversion
// is: A BIT OR'd ONTO A STYLE, never a second enum value. The stored setting
// in the EEPROM is a Style and has to keep meaning exactly what it meant
// before; this is a rendering mode MODE applies on top of it.
//
// 0x20 sits below S_INVERT's 0x40 and clear of S_COUNT (11), with room for the
// enum to keep growing underneath both.
