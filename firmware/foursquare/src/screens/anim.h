// anim.h — the DOWN page. The four 48x48 bitmap animations carried over from
// the old breadboard 2x2 clock (oled2x2x, Wokwi animator, art by icons8), plus
// seventeen PROCEDURAL ones drawn with GFX primitives.
//
// PURE, like faces.cpp and pages.cpp: handed a canvas and a tick, nothing
// else. That is what lets the prover enumerate every frame of every animation
// and prove none of them draws outside the shift envelope.
//
// WHY THE NEW ONES ARE PROCEDURAL AND NOT MORE BITMAPS. A bitmap animation is
// a list of initialisers, and a list of initialisers can be one short — which
// is exactly what happened to the heart (see anim.cpp). A procedural animation
// is a pure function of the tick, so there is no frame table to get out of step
// with a declared count, and it costs a few hundred bytes of flash instead of
// 8 KB. It also scales: a 48x48 bitmap cannot be shrunk (a scaled 1-bit bitmap
// is a smear), so four eyes on one panel was only ever going to be drawable.
//
// WHY EVERYTHING STAYS INSIDE THE SAFE AREA. The original walker walked off
// both edges of the panel. Here he turns around at the safe margin instead, and
// every procedural animation is composed through safe-area-clipped primitives.
// Ink outside the safe area would be clipped once the anti-burn-in wander
// reaches its extremes — and on an animation that would read as a rendering bug
// rather than as a policy. The safe area is SAFE_X0..SAFE_X1 by SAFE_Y0..SAFE_Y1
// from display.h, which on THIS build is x[6..121] y[6..57] — 116x52. Nothing
// in anim.cpp types those numbers; every extent is derived from the constants.
// In the sibling tree the same code runs against a 110-column safe area (the
// calibration nudge is bought out of the columns there), and a bar row that
// assumed 116 is exactly how the last channel of the equaliser ended up under
// the clip. Derive, never type.

// are, what order to play them in, and how long one whole idea lasts.

// Out of range returns AN_WALK.

// true common period is 419,543 frames (14.6 hours), which is the point of it.
// What it returns instead is a length over which every eye blinks at least

// little weather drawings. All pure: canvas + tick in, pixels out.

// ---- the walker's pass -----------------------------------------------------
// ONE RULE OF MOTION: he walks. Horizontally, at constant speed, in one
// direction, and that is ALL he does — he never stops, never turns, never
// moves vertically, never teleports. (The v3 lap had descent/ascent legs and
// a mid-panel turn; the user cut them.) A pass enters from OFF the glass at
// one side edge of a row, walks continuously across BOTH panels of that row
// — crossing the bezel with the established one-frame hidden beat — and
// exits fully off the far edge.
//
// GROUND SPEED IS THE ARTWORK'S, MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN. The physics of a
// non-sliding walk: while a foot is planted it stays at a fixed x on the
// GLASS, so the body must advance at exactly the rate the artwork sweeps the
// planted foot backward through the sprite box. This artwork (measured by
// the foot-plant tool, plantview.cpp in the session scratchpad) is a HYBRID
// in-place cycle: each 14-frame half-step holds the planted foot ~5 frames,
// then sweeps it back ~1.3 px/frame over ~9 frames — a mean stride of
// SR_STRIDE_PX = 1 px per artwork frame (13-14 px per half-step). Rendered
// and measured at this stride: the planted foot's glass movement is 0 px on
// 66% of tick pairs, mean 0.37 px, max 2 px on the artwork's roughest
// transition — identical on all four pass variants — and the net foot drift
// is ~0 at tempos 1-4, so he cannot moonwalk at any setting. (1 px/frame is
// the same rate the roster's AN_WALK has always used, which is why that
// walker never read as skating.)
//
// ONE KNOB: WALKER_TEMPO, artwork frames per render tick. Ground speed and
// gait rate BOTH derive from it through the measured stride, so foot-plant
// sync holds at every setting — change the tempo and he walks faster, he
// never skates or moonwalks. At the walker segment's 63 ms tick (16 fps,
// affordable because a crossing dirties one panel per tick):
//   1 = walk, 16 px/s   (SHIPS — every artwork frame shown, 1 px steps)
//   2 = brisk, 32 px/s  (every 2nd frame)
//   3 = hurried, 48 px/s
//   4 = run-ish, 64 px/s
//
// The VARIANT is two bits, chosen at RUNTIME by ui.cpp's scheduler per pass:
//   bit 0  row        0 = top (TL,TR)     1 = bottom (BL,BR)
//   bit 1  direction  0 = left-to-right   1 = right-to-left (mirrored sprite)

// reported it as "sometimes skips a frame", which is exactly what it was.
//
// The frame tables are now unsized and counted by the compiler, and the count
// is static_asserted, so that particular hole is closed. This is the second
// lock: the prover requires every frame of every animation to light at least
// one pixel unless the animation DECLARES that it wants a blank one. Nothing
// declares it today. Getting a blank frame by accident is a failure; getting
// one on purpose costs an edit to this predicate and a sentence saying why.
