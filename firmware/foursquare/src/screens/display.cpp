// THE PANEL CLOCK, IN ONE PLACE. 800 kHz is 2x the SSD1306 datasheet figure,
// which these modules are commonly run at and well past on short traces —
// this board is 74 mm end to end with proper pull-ups (R1/R2), so the edges
// have every chance of surviving. It is an EXPERIMENT with a bench soak
// standing behind it, not a datasheet number: if the soak (or any later `?`
// report) shows I2C errors or visual corruption, set this back to 400000UL —
// this one constant is the whole change.
//
// THE PANELS ARE THE ONLY THING THAT RUNS AT THIS SPEED. clkAfter (below)
// hands the bus back at BUS_PERIPH_HZ — the same 400 kHz bus_begin() sets —
// because the DS3231, 24LC256 and PCA9548A are 400 kHz parts by datasheet.
// Overclocking the panel payload is an experiment the soak can retire;
// running the RTC out of spec between commits would be a defect, and one
// with no symptom until a corrupted read.

// every display(), every ssd1306_command() and every begin() — so the
// four-argument form means bus_begin()'s Wire.setClock(400000) holds only
// until the first panel write, and the DS3231, SHT31, EEPROM and mux then run

// apart, 255 and 1 look nearly the same — which is exactly the "dimming isn't
// working" symptom this cost a session to find.
//
// Contrast is also the LIFETIME knob, not a comfort setting: it is a linear
// segment-current control (ISEG = C/256 x IREF x 8) and OLED half-life goes
// as roughly J^-n. THE EXPONENT IS 1.82, NOT THE 1.4 THIS FILE USED TO CLAIM:
// 1.4 came from a simulation of a different emitter, whereas 1.82 is the
// median of the panel makers' own tiered lifetime-vs-brightness tables, and
// measured literature converges on 1.4-2.0. Dimming is worth MORE than we
// credited it -- the day cap is 3.6x, not 2.7x, and 140 -> 120 buys 1.32x for
// a dim nobody can see. The panel behind these modules (Univision
// UG-2864HSWEG01, doc SAS1-9046-B rev B section 5.2) is rated 10,000 h min to
// half brightness at 100 cd/m2 on a 50% checkerboard, and this one runs 24/7,
// which is 8,760 h a year.

// does change the charge delivered per row period, so it scales EMISSION DUTY
// and therefore lifetime too. The wear model's flat 1/64 duty constant is
// wrong: real per-pixel duty is (1/64)(50/K), which makes the night branch

// A HAMILTONIAN TOUR OF THE OFFSET GRID, not a random walk.

// WHY THE RANDOM WALK WENT. firmware B's walk was biased, and badly:
//
//     int8_t dx = (r & 3) - 1;   // 0,1,2,3 -> -1, 0, +1, +2
//     if (dx > 1) dx = -1;       // the +2 folded back onto -1
//
// Two of the four equally-likely outcomes were -1, so P(-1)=1/2, P(0)=1/4,
// P(+1)=1/4 and the mean step was -0.25 px. That is not a walk, it is a slide:
// from centre it reached the -6 wall in ~24 ticks and stayed pinned, because
// leaving meant winning at 2:1 odds every step. The stationary distribution is
// geometric with ratio 1/2, so the corner (-6,-6) alone took 25% of all time
// and the far corner about one part in 16 million. Effective spread was ~9 of
// the 169 offsets -- a 19x shortfall against the uniform box the file's own
// comment claimed. Unbiasing the step fixes the drift and gives a uniform
// distribution in EXPECTATION, but a walk still clumps: over one evening the
// image is parked in a neighbourhood, since a lazy walk over 13 states has a
// relaxation time of ~(2A+1)^2/pi^2 ~ 17 steps and takes hours to mix.
//
// SO WE DO NOT LEAVE IT TO CHANCE. A boustrophedon tour visits every offset
// EXACTLY once per pass, so residency is exactly uniform per cycle rather than
// uniform on average -- no clumping, no variance, nothing to get unlucky with.
// The archived spec rejected "a cycle" because "a repeating path would still
// leave the long-run average brightest at the positions it visits most". That
// is true of a Lissajous or a LUT path and FALSE BY CONSTRUCTION of a
// Hamiltonian tour, which by definition weights every offset identically.
//
// AND IT IS TRAVERSED THERE AND BACK. A (2A+1)^2 grid is odd x odd, which by a
// parity argument admits no Hamiltonian CYCLE -- only a path. Running the path
// forward then backward keeps every step 1 px (no jump home) and still visits
// every offset exactly twice per 2*M cycle, so uniformity is exact either way.
// At +/-6 and 1 px/60 s a full cycle is 338 min. gcd(338, 1440) = 2, so the
// tour does not sit in step with the day.
//
// One pixel per event stays deliberate: a larger jump reads as the image
// twitching, and the point is that nobody ever notices this happening.
