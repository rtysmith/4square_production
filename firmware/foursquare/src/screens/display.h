// Every pixel that has ever been lit on this device passed through
// disp_commit(). That is not a convention, it is a structural fact:
//
//   * The four Adafruit_SSD1306 objects have INTERNAL LINKAGE in display.cpp.
//     Nothing outside that translation unit can name them, so nothing outside
//     it can write to a panel.
//   * Drawing code is handed a GFXcanvas1 — plain RAM. It cannot reach I2C.
//   * The shift, the brightness cap and the night policy are applied during
//     the blit from canvas to panel, after all drawing is finished.
//
// So a new clock face cannot forget to be burn-in safe, and cannot opt out.
// The one thing a layout CAN get wrong is drawing outside the safe area, and
// that is what tools/layoutcheck proves it does not — on the host, from the
// same source, before it ever runs.

// the same place for the life of the device. Ink outside the safe area would
// be clipped at the extremes of that wander, so the safe area is a hard
// contract on every layout, asserted on the host.

// against a size-6 stroke, and simulated peak per-pixel duty is 0.667 at both
// +/-0 and +/-2 -- identical to three decimals. firmware B shipped a DEFAULT of
// 2, i.e. the anti-burn-in shift was a placebo at its default setting, and

// actually see through the assembled case. It costs the safe area BIAS_MAX at
