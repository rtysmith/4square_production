// pages.h — version A: four buttons, four pages.
//
// THE GRAMMAR, in one sentence:
//   each button owns a page, and pressing it again cycles a variant of it.
//
//   MODE  -> the clock        (again: next clock style)
//   SET   -> sensor readings  (again: next reading set)
//   UP    -> markets          (again: next basket of symbols)
//   DOWN  -> animations       (again: next animation)
//
// All four panels render the same page, one slot each. There is no menu, no
// modal editor and no "PREVIEW" caption — a press changes what you are looking
// at, immediately, and that is the whole interface.
//
// EVERYTHING IN HERE IS PURE, for exactly the reason faces.h is: it is handed
// a GFXcanvas1 and a snapshot, so tools/layoutcheck compiles THIS source and
// proves no two elements share a pixel on any page, slot or variant.
