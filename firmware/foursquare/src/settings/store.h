// WHY AN EEPROM AND NOT NVS. U3 is a real DIP-8 24LC256 in a socket on the
// main I2C bus; it is on the board precisely so settings survive. Using it
// instead of the ESP32's NVS also means a firmware flash — including a
// partition-table change, which erases NVS — never loses the user's setup.

// a device that shows the same digit in the same place for years.
// Version A: BARS and DOTS are gone. They were built, looked at on the real
// glass and rejected — a 12-bar gauge and a binary dot row are both puzzles
// rather than clocks. SHADOW and STENCIL replace them: still hollow, still
// inside the burn-in budget, but legible at a glance from across a room.

// silently relabel every saved record, which is the exact class of bug the
