// The previous firmware recovered from a bus fault with Wire.end() then

// interrupted mid-byte holds SDA low and keeps holding it, and re-initialising
// the master does not make it let go. The only thing that does is clocking SCL
// until the slave finishes the byte it thinks it is transmitting.
//
// The SHT31 is read in clock-stretch mode, so it holds SCL by design and is
// the part most able to wedge the bus if a joint is marginal.
//
//   L0  retry once — most errors are a single NAK
//   L1  nine SCL pulses + a STOP, bit-banged: frees a stuck slave
//   L2  full Wire re-init
//   L3  reset the mux by deselecting all channels
//   L4  give up for this cycle and report a fault to the LEDs
