// two colours may not be adjacent is a rule somebody has to remember, and this

// exist cannot come back by accident, and tools/ledcheck asserts it — no frame
// this file emits may be green-dominant, and no transition may put a blue or

// the two frames either side of it are.
//
// So every change of state fades the outgoing frame out and the incoming one
// in. It DIPS THROUGH BLACK rather than cross-blending the two colours, and
// that is not laziness: a linear blend invents a hue neither state owns, and
// cyan -> amber passes straight through green, which is the one thing this file
// is not allowed to produce. Dipping also gives each state a clean entrance,
// which is what makes the column's movement legible.
//
// The outgoing frame is FROZEN at the moment of the switch — its gait stops
// advancing — so only one animation is ever being evaluated. The incoming one
// keeps running under the fade, so a state does not appear to start late.
