// D2, D4 and D5 form a VERTICAL COLUMN on the board: D2 top, D4 middle, D5
// bottom, in that chain order. That geometry is the whole language — a state
// is not just a colour, it is a movement along the column, and movement is far
// easier to read across a dark room than a hue is.
//
// (These three were reverse-mounted on the rev O build — the GL5050's chamfer
// marks pin 3/GND, not pin 1 — and were hot-air rotated on 2026-08-07. Any
// design note that assumes they are not fitted is stale.)

// IDLE IS DARK. This lives in a bedroom. An indicator that is always doing
// something is an indicator you stop reading.

// from the intended 60 Hz to nearer 10 Hz and does so unevenly. A gait driven
// by a frame COUNTER would stutter and change speed with whatever the panels
// were doing; driven by `now` it merely gets sampled more coarsely, which is
// the difference between an animation that limps and one that is simply drawn
// less often. The one thing that genuinely cannot survive the coarse sampling
// is the temporal dither, so it measures the real interval and switches itself

// R7 sits 9.5 mm from D2 on the same board face, so the LDR reads our own LEDs
// unless they are off: light_sample() has to blank the strip to measure the
// ROOM. It used to do that by reaching into `strip` directly and leaving it
// black until the next led_tick — a 25 ms hard-edged hole punched into every
// animation, once a second, which is the black notch the user reported as
// flicker.
//
// So the blank is bracketed here instead, and the strip is private to leds.cpp
// again. begin() returns FALSE when the strip is already dark, in which case
// there is nothing to blank, no settling to wait for and no hole to punch —
// which, since IDLE IS DARK, is the common case. When it returns true it has
// eased the strip down rather than cutting it, and end() eases it back to the
// exact frame that was showing, so the LED image is continuous across the read.

// ---- the failsafes ---------------------------------------------------------
// A HELD STATE IS A NOTIFICATION, NOT A STATUS BAR. Every sticky state above
// is asserted by a condition that can fail to clear — a missing panel, a join
// that never succeeds — and each one is therefore given a time budget in
// leds.cpp. When it lapses the state stops being RENDERED while remaining
// asserted, so the bedroom goes dark and the serial report still says why.
//
// millis() when led_ota_progress() last ran, or 0 if no transfer has started.
// loop() uses it to recover from an OTA that ended without firing onEnd or
// onError — the one failure that leaves the LEDs lit with the main loop
// short-circuited and the loop watchdog switched off.

// Held states and how much of their budget is left, for the serial `P` report.

// The two tables above, readable. led_report() uses them, and so does the LED
// prover (tools/ledcheck), which asserts mechanically that EVERY state which is
// not a one-shot has a hold budget — the failsafe described above is worth
// nothing if a state added next year quietly has neither.
