// ui.h — version A: buttons, page selection, and deciding what to repaint.
//
// THE GRAMMAR, in one sentence:
//   each button owns a page, and pressing it again cycles a variant of it.
//
//   MODE  clock     SET  sensors     UP  markets     DOWN  animations
//
// There is no menu, no modal editor and nothing to get stuck in: every button
// is always a direct jump to a page you can see the name of. Settings that
// used to need the menu are reachable over serial (`P`, `D`, `F`) and by long
// press for the two that matter day to day.
