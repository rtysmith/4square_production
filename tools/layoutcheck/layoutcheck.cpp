// layoutcheck — prove, pixel by pixel, that nothing on any screen overlaps
// anything else on that screen, and that everything stays inside the area the
// anti-burn-in shift is allowed to move it around in.
//
// HOW IT PROVES RATHER THAN CHECKS
//
// The naive version of this tool renders a screen and looks at the result. That
// cannot detect an overlap at all: two elements that share a pixel produce a
// single lit pixel, indistinguishable from one element lighting it. By the time
// you have an image, the evidence is gone.
//
// So instead each element is lifted into its own bitmap as it is drawn. The
// firmware marks element boundaries with ELEM(); this tool installs a hook on
// that marker which snapshots and clears the canvas at every boundary. What
// comes out is N disjoint-by-construction bitmaps whose pairwise AND is the
// overlap, exactly and with coordinates.
//
// It compiles faces.cpp and ui_render.cpp — THE SOURCE THAT SHIPS — against the
// real Adafruit_GFX and the real 5x7 font. Nothing about the geometry is
// reimplemented here, so a pass is a statement about the device and not about
// a model of it.

// ===========================================================================
// THE FRAME-SEQUENCE LAWS — AN ANIMATION MAY NOT SKIP
// ===========================================================================
// WHY THIS EXISTS, IN ONE PARAGRAPH. heartFrames was declared [28][288] with 27
// initialisers. C++ zero-fills the rest, so heartFrames[27] was 288 bytes of
// nothing, anim_count(AN_HEART) went on saying 28, and anim_draw's `tick % n`
// reached it once every 28 frames — every 3.5 s at 8 fps — rendering the heart
// as an empty panel for one frame and bringing it back the next. The user
// reported it as "sometimes skips a frame".
//
// EVERY LAW ALREADY IN THIS FILE WAS GREEN THROUGH IT, and correctly so: a
// blank canvas has no overlap, nothing outside the safe area, no clipped
// glyphs and a fill factor of zero, which is the best score available. Judging
// frames ONE AT A TIME cannot see a defect that is only visible in the
// SEQUENCE. So these four laws judge the sequence:
//
//   BLANK      every frame of every cycle lights at least one pixel, unless
//              anim_blank_ok() declares that the animation wants a blank one.
//              Nothing declares it. This is the law that catches the heart.
//   COUNT      the frame count the firmware reports matches the count this
//              file expects — read from outside anim.cpp's translation unit,
//              so it is a second reading of the same fact rather than a
//              restatement of the static_assert next to the data.
//   PERIOD     anim_cycle_exact(id) is checked, not believed: frame t and
//              frame t + anim_cycle(id) are compared as bitmaps, for every t
//              in the cycle. A reel that trusts a wrong period cuts a beat.
//   CONTINUITY the change in lit pixels across the WRAP is no larger than the
//              largest change anywhere MID-cycle. A loop that jumps at the
//              seam is the same family of defect as one that goes blank —
//              a frame the eye reads as missing — and it is the one a blank
//              check alone would not see.
//
// And judge() runs on every frame too, over the WHOLE cycle rather than the
// first few hundred ticks the page sweep reaches, so the walker's 868-frame
// pace is now proven end to end. The case labels start with "ANIM" because
// that is how judge() recognises a transient frame and holds it to the
// reported-not-gated fill budget; the plants below start with "SELFTEST" for
// the same reason.
