// WHY THIS IS A SHIM AND NOT A REIMPLEMENTATION. Same rule the layout prover
// works under: the value of the store prover is that it exercises the exact
// source that ships, so anything reimplemented here is something the prover
// could be wrong about. This file contains no store logic, no CRC, no ring —
// only Print (so a Serial exists), the PROGMEM macros, and a millis() the
// deferred-write timer can read. The EEPROM itself is modelled in Wire.h,
// which is a model of the CHIP, not of the code under test.
