# Build and run the LED prover.
#
# Same contract as tools/layoutcheck/build.sh, and for the same reason: this
# compiles the FIRMWARE'S OWN leds.cpp -- the source that ships -- so what it
# proves is a property of the shipping binary and not of a model of it. The only
# things modelled are the WS2812 strip (shim/Adafruit_NeoPixel.h), which is the
# part the PC does not have, the 24LC256 behind `cfg` (shim/Wire.h), and
# disp_light_window(), which belongs to the display layer and is documented as
# modelled at the top of ledcheck.cpp.
#
# store.cpp and defaults.cpp come along because leds.cpp reads `cfg` -- the real
# led_mode and led_bright the device boots with. Linking the real ones rather
# than declaring a stub `cfg` is the same discipline layoutcheck works under: a
# stub would let the LED layer agree with a settings inventory the device does
# not have. faces.cpp and Adafruit_GFX follow defaults.cpp, which calls
# widget_allows().
#
# The shim here is a FULL one rather than a borrow from a sibling prover: this
# tree has no storecheck to share Arduino.h/Wire.h with.
#
# Nonzero exit means do not flash. 4square-flash-c.sh gates on it.
#
# scriptcheck exception: DONE marker. This is a prover, not an action script,
# and its finish marker is the line the gate greps for -- "RESULT: PASS" or
# "RESULT: FAIL -- n of m checks failed", printed by ledcheck.cpp's main().
# A second, different DONE line would be a second thing that could disagree
# with the exit code. Same convention as tools/layoutcheck/build.sh.
