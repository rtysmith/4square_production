// ledcheck — the LED prover, a gate in the same sense the layout, store, graph
// and network provers are gates.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-19 the user's report of the LED layer was "really
// choppy... It looks like it's flickering. I hate that." Three separate causes
// were found by reading the source, and all three were the kind of thing no
// amount of careful reading catches TWICE:
//
//   1. sensors.cpp blanked the whole strip for 25 ms, once a second, forever,
//      to read the LDR — a black notch punched into every animation.
//   2. The temporal dither in led_tick() is a 60 fps mechanism, and the real
//      cadence on the animation page is nearer 10 Hz, so it was generating the
//      flicker it exists to remove.
//   3. render() CUT between states, and half the gaits were square waves.
//
// Every one of those is a statement about NUMBERS OVER TIME, which is exactly
// what a host prover can see and a person staring at three LEDs cannot. So this
// compiles the FIRMWARE'S OWN leds.cpp — the source that ships — against a host
// model of the WS2812 (shim/Adafruit_NeoPixel.h), drives it at the design rate
// AND at the degraded rate the panels really leave it, and asserts:
//
//   - THE SLEW LAW: no channel moves faster than 4.5 units per millisecond of
//     wall time. Sampled at 1 ms, 16 ms and 100 ms. A hard cut is 255 in one
//     sample at any rate and cannot hide.
//   - LOOP CONTINUITY: an animation that wraps is exactly periodic and does not
//     jump at the seam.
//   - NO BLUE -> GREEN, ever: not between states, not within a state, not
//     during a transition. Encoded as "no frame this file emits may be
//     green-dominant", which is a rule that cannot be forgotten back in.
//   - THE DITHER LAW: at the degraded rate a constant input must give a
//     constant output. This is cause (2) stated as an assertion.
//   - HOLD BUDGETS: every state that is not a one-shot has one, and a lapsed
//     state renders dark.
//   - GAMMA EXACTLY ONCE, against an independent reference, plus the arithmetic
//     headroom the comment in led_tick() claims.
//   - strip.begin() called EXACTLY ONCE.
//
// What it structurally CANNOT see, and it is worth knowing which:
//   - the WS2812 itself: real timing, the 5 V buffer, a marginal joint. The
//     model always latches.
//   - the human question. "4.5 units per millisecond is smooth" is a judgement
//     (see SLEW_MAX_PER_MS below for how it was derived); the prover only holds
//     the code to it.
//   - disp_light_window(), which lives in display.cpp and is modelled here —
//     see the note on it below.
